* Not all objects are renderable any more.

* If things ARE renderable, the views rendering the scene will pass them to the renderer.

* properties can be registered as either a specific variable or a pair of functions (get/set)

* propertiesObject ALREADY inherits serializable, so its output already saves the object's props.
  The required modification is that a gmoBase being serialized will need to stick its prefab at
  the front of the list.
  
* group is succeded by scene. Scene can still be limited to certain object types, but dynamically
  now, meaning that we don't have to register ever goddamn type of scene for chai to recognise it.
  
* Can't do this with hooks unfortunately - notify() function won't work anymore
