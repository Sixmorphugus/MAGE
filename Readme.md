You can easily compile the engine with CMake (https://cmake.org/). If you're going to make a game with it, however:
1. Wait for me to actually finish and document the engine.
2. Use the MAGEDevkit (https://github.com/Sixmorphugus/MAGEDevkit) which includes a cool level editor and example project already written in for you.
